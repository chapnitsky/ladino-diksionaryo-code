            If we recognize it as a word in Ladino we'll display it and its translations.
            If it is not in our list of Ladino words we'll try to see if it is a word in one of the other languages. If it is we'll show the Ladino translation and its meanings.

        <li>We don't try to understand the context or the full expression. It is still your job to decide which meaning of a word is relevant in the specific context.</li>
