       This site is based on the dictionary provided by GÃ¼ler Orgun, Ricardo Portal i Antonio Ruiz Tinoco and more specifically
       the Excel file from the <a href="https://ladinokomunita.groups.io/">Ladinokomunita</a>. (currently we are in the process of
       integrating the data from that file into the site.)
       In addition the site includes lots of words and expressions from the course created for <a href="https://librelingo.app/">LibreLingo</a>.
       The source code of the LibreLingo data can be found in <div><a href="https://github.com/szabgab/LibreLingo-Judeo-Spanish-from-English">this repository</a>.
       The files from the Ladinokomunita dictionary can be found in <a href="https://github.com/szabgab/ladino-diksionaryo-data">this repository</a>.
       This site was created and is being maintained by Gabor Szabo.
